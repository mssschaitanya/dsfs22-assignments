    "Python objects that iterate through iterable objects are called Iterators. It is used to iterate over objects by returning one value at a time. Iterators are created by using the iter() function. The function next() is used to get the subsequent value from the iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a type of function that returns a generator object, which can return a sequence of values instead of a single result. The def keyword is commonly used to define generators. At least one yield statement is required in a generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators are created using classes whereas generators are created using functions.Iterators donâ€™t use any variables to iterate whereas generators use local variables and store the state of those variables whenever the loop is paused by the yield statement. In Python, all generators are iterators. This can be proved by the fact that generators are a subclass of iterators."
